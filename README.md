# Digital-Design-on-FPGA--VSDOpen21
## About the tutorial workshop:
This course will be an in-depth hands-on demo session on the Virtual FPGA Lab using the open-source Makerchip IDE Web platform. The course will start with the introduction of why we need Virtual FPGA Lab and going through the Github repository. Then we will introduce the participants to Verilog. Theory is useful, but nothing beats practice!!  We will design a 4-way traffic light controller using the concept of Finite State Machines in Verilog. We then visualize the output with LEDs and seven-segment displays in the Makerchip Virtual FPGA platform. Every part of this course has a theory followed by a lab.The student is required to have just a basic understanding of logic gates and no knowledge of the EDA tools is required.
